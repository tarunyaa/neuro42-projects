## Neuro42 Projects

neuro42, Inc. is a medtech Company advancing futuristic technologies for screening, diagnosis, and targeted treatment of neurological conditions. My role as an intern was to design, develop and prototype analog RF circuits for generation 2 of neuro42. Incâ€™s MRI system. Their low-field MRI is a complex system consisting of various circuits. I was tasked with the development of circuits for the BB Preamp, RF Coils, T/R Switch, and Radio Frequency Power Amplifier (RFPA). 

## Step-Up Voltage Converter
Researched and simulated different methods of step-up voltage conversion such as non-inverting op-amp, boost converter IC, and non-inverter digital CMOS buffer. Selected digital buffer package, soldered test circuit, and tested its behavior using oscilloscope and function generator.

## 90 Degree Hybrid
Selected, sourced and soldered appropriate adjustable inductors for the circuit. Successfully tested and tuned its behavior using an oscilloscope and function generator. Designed a PCB for it. Further tested the behavior of other directional couplers in-lab using an oscilloscope and function generator.

## Active T/R Switch
Developed understanding of the design of the circuit schematic. Designed version 1 of PCB for it. Successfully soldered, tested and debugged its behavior with regular and low power PIN diodes. Designed the final version of PCB for it. Successfully soldered, tested and debugged its behavior with high power PIN diodes. Used oscilloscope and function generator.

## Balun & Match
Designed a PCB for it.

## Amplifier IC
Designed a PCB for it. Used online calculator and network analyser for impedance matching. Soldered, tested, and debugged the circuit using an oscilloscope and function generator.

## Differential Cascode Amplifier
Read scholarly articles and textbooks to design schematic for two versions of the differential cascode amplifier: power and low noise. Selected transistors for each. Designed multiple PCBs for it, each for a different transistor or to investigate a different noise reduction technique. Soldered, tested, and debugged multiple amplifier boards along with tune and match boards using oscilloscope, function generator, and network analyser. Successfully built power single-ended cascode amplifier. Differential amplifiers and low noise amplifiers are active areas of research that were unable to be resolved by the end of the internship.
